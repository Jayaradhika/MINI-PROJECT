# MINI-PROJECT
This Python code provides a basic framework for simulating a Monopoly game. It models player turns, dice rolls, and movement around a 40-space board. Players start with $1500 and advance based on dice outcomes, with each turn printing movement details. It does not include property buying or rent, serving as a foundation for further development.
